    "This notebook explores the difference between classical and quantum algorithms through the lens of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The problems demonstrate quantum advantage by showing how quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm determines whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced using only one query to the function, whereas a classical computer would need multiple queries in the worst case."
