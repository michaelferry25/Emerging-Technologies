    "This notebook explores the difference between classical and quantum algorithms through the lens of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The problems demonstrate quantum advantage by showing how quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm determines whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced using only one query to the function, whereas a classical computer would need multiple queries in the worst case."

    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is designed to work with functions that accept a fixed number of Boolean inputs and return a single Boolean output.\n",

    "Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns False or always returns True) or balanced (returns True for exactly half of the possible input combinations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function `random_constant_balanced` that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs."
